The current year is 1302.

There are three big kingdoms: Solarae, Sylvantia and Frostfallen.

Frostfallen has become infested with dark creatures.

There are several types of dark creatures that inhabit Frostfallen, for example the Dark Slime, a creature is inmune to physical damage, it's about 1 meter tall.

There are a few villages scattered throughout Frostfallen, but they are not as populous or as thriving as they once were.

The people who remain in Frostfallen are struggling to survive against the dark creatures that now plague the land.

In Frostfallen there is a village called Wretched Hollow that is infested with Goblin.
